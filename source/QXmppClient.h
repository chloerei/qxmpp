/// \class QXmppClient
/// \brief The QXmppClient is the main class for using QXmpp.
///
/// It provides the user all the required functionality to connect to the server
/// and perform operations afterwards.
///
/// This class will provide the handle/reference to QXmppRoster (roster management),
///  QXmppVCardManager (vCard manager) and QXmppReconnectionManager (reconnection
/// mechanism).
///
/// By default, a reconnection mechanism exists, which makes sure of reconnecting
/// to the server on dissconnections due to an error. User can have a custom
/// reconnection mechanism as well.
