/// \class QXmppRoster
/// \brief Class for handling the roster of the connected client.
///
/// \note It's object should not be created using it's constructor. Instead
/// QXmppClient::getRoster() should be used to get the reference of instantiated
/// object this class.
///
/// It stores all the Roster and Presence details of all the roster entries (that
/// is all the bareJids) in the client's friend's list. It provides the
/// functionality to get all the bareJids in the client's roster and Roster and
/// Presence details of the same.
///
/// After the sucessfull xmpp connection that after the signal QXmppClient::connected()
/// is emitted QXmpp requests for getting the roster. Once QXmpp receives the roster
/// the signal QXmppRoster::rosterReceived() is emitted and after that user can
/// use the functions of this class to get roster entries.
///
/// Function QXmppRoster::isRosterReceived() tells whether the roster has been
/// received or not.
///
/// Signals presenceChanged() or rosterChanged() are emitted whenever presence
/// or roster changes respectively.
